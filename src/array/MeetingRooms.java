/**
 * The "Meeting Rooms" problem is about determining if a person can attend all their meetings without overlap. Given an
 * array of intervals where each interval represents a meeting time [start, end], the goal is to check if any of these
 * intervals overlap. If thereâ€™s overlap, return False; otherwise, return True.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Input: [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
 * Output: False (since the meetings overlap).
